# Prolog-Project
Project realized for the subject Declarative Programming at Univeristy of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn together with my colleague [@zeusthegoddd][https://github.com/Zeusthegoddd].
Topic: Books and comics

The aim of the project is to describe simple relationships and facts
related to books and comics. The program consists of three parts:
1. Book knowledge base (constructed with a real dataset)
2. Functions for books and comics
3. Functions for libraries

Book data sourced from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks
We decided to do this in order to show that this project could be a real use case for libraries or book shops and to avoid creating artificial data that does not align with the reality.
